# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — start dev server (Cloudflare workerd runtime)
- `npm run build` — production build (SSR via `@astrojs/cloudflare`)
- `npm run preview` — preview production build
- `npm run lint` — ESLint with type-checked rules
- `npm run lint:fix` — auto-fix lint issues
- `npm run format` — Prettier (includes prettier-plugin-astro + prettier-plugin-tailwindcss)

No test runner is configured. Pre-commit hooks (husky + lint-staged) run `eslint --fix` on `*.{ts,tsx,astro}` and `prettier --write` on `*.{json,css,md}`.

Before first build, run `npx astro sync` to generate virtual module types (required for `astro:env/server` imports to resolve).

## Architecture

Astro 6 SSR app with React 19 islands, Tailwind 4, Supabase auth, and shadcn/ui components. Deployed to Cloudflare Workers.

### Rendering and routing

Full SSR (`output: "server"` in astro.config.mjs). All pages are server-rendered. There is no static prerendering.

- Pages: `src/pages/` (Astro file-based routing)
- API routes: `src/pages/api/` — export uppercase HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`); validate input with zod
- Layout: `src/layouts/Layout.astro` — wraps all pages, renders missing-config banners via `src/lib/config-status.ts`

### Auth flow

Supabase auth is optional — the app runs without credentials (auth features are disabled, `createClient` returns `null`). When configured:

- `src/lib/supabase.ts` — creates Supabase SSR client using cookie-based sessions. Env vars (`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_KEY`) come from `astro:env/server` (declared in astro.config.mjs `env.schema` as optional server secrets).
- `src/middleware.ts` — resolves user on every request, sets `context.locals.user`. Redirects unauthenticated users from `PROTECTED_ROUTES` to `/auth/signin`.
- `src/env.d.ts` — declares `App.Locals` with `user: User | null`.
- Auth API: `src/pages/api/auth/{signin,signup,signout}.ts`
- Auth UI: `src/pages/auth/{signin,signup,confirm-email}.astro`

### Key conventions

- **Import order**: group imports separated by a blank line, each preceded by a comment header:
  1. `// core` — framework and library imports (react, astro, supabase, zod)
  2. `// components` — component imports (Astro and React components, UI primitives)
  3. `// others` — types, hooks, constants, utilities, services
- **Astro components** for layout/static content; **React components** (`client:*` directives) only when interactivity is needed.
- **Tailwind classes**: always merge with `cn()` from `@/lib/utils`. Never concatenate class strings manually.
- **shadcn/ui**: components in `src/components/ui/`, "new-york" style. Add new ones with `npx shadcn@latest add [name]`.
- **React**: no Next.js directives ("use client"/"use server"). Extract hooks to `src/components/hooks/`.
- **Services/helpers**: `src/lib/` (or `src/lib/services/` for extracted business logic).
- **Shared types**: `src/types.ts` (entities, DTOs).
- **Supabase migrations**: `supabase/migrations/` with format `YYYYMMDDHHmmss_short_description.sql`. Always enable RLS on new tables with per-operation, per-role policies.

### Environment

- Node.js v22.14.0 (`.nvmrc`)
- Local Supabase: `npx supabase start` (requires Docker)
- Deploy: `npx wrangler deploy`

## CI

GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): runs `astro sync` + lint + build on push/PR to `master`. Requires `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` as repository secrets.

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 2, Lesson 1

Move from sprint-zero setup to project orchestration with the **roadmap chain**:

```
(Module 1 foundation docs) -> /10x-roadmap -> backlog-ready roadmap items
```

`/10x-roadmap` is the lesson focus. `/10x-new` is intentionally introduced in Module 2, Lesson 2, when a selected roadmap item becomes an implementation change folder.

### Task Router - Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Roadmap (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-roadmap` | You have `context/foundation/prd.md` and a scaffolded project baseline, and you need a vertical-first MVP roadmap. The skill reads the PRD, inspects the code baseline, uses available foundation docs such as `tech-stack.md`, `infrastructure.md`, and `deploy-plan.md`, then writes `context/foundation/roadmap.md`. Use it BEFORE creating per-change folders or implementation plans. |
| **Re-run upstream if needed** | |
| `/10x-shape` / `/10x-prd` / `/10x-tech-stack-selector` / `/10x-bootstrapper` / `/10x-agents-md` / `/10x-infra-research` | Bundled from Module 1 so foundation contracts can be fixed before roadmap sequencing. If roadmap generation exposes a PRD gap, repair the PRD before pretending the backlog is ready. |

### How the chain hands off

- `/10x-roadmap` bridges product and implementation. It does not choose frameworks, design schemas, or write a per-change implementation plan.
- The output is `context/foundation/roadmap.md`: ordered milestones, vertical slices, bounded foundations, dependencies, unknowns, risk, and backlog handoff fields.
- Roadmap items should receive stable human-readable identifiers in backlog tools. The actual `context/changes/<change-id>/` folder is created in Lesson 2 with `/10x-new`.

### Roadmap boundaries

- Default to vertical slices: user-visible outcomes that cross UI, data, business logic, and integrations.
- Horizontal work is allowed only as a bounded enabler that names the downstream vertical milestone it unlocks.
- Avoid orphan horizontal work such as "build the whole database", "build all API endpoints", or "design the whole UI" before the first user-visible flow.
- Roadmap is not a calendar estimate. Do not invent dates, story points, or sprint velocity unless the user explicitly asks for a separate planning artifact.

### Foundation paths used by this lesson

- `context/foundation/prd.md` - input
- `context/foundation/tech-stack.md` - optional input
- `context/foundation/infrastructure.md` - optional input
- `context/deployment/deploy-plan.md` - optional input
- `context/foundation/roadmap.md` - output
- `context/foundation/lessons.md` - recurring rules and pitfalls
- `docs/reference/contract-surfaces.md` - load-bearing names registry

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."
