# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — start dev server (Cloudflare workerd runtime)
- `npm run build` — production build (SSR via `@astrojs/cloudflare`)
- `npm run preview` — preview production build
- `npm run lint` — ESLint with type-checked rules
- `npm run lint:fix` — auto-fix lint issues
- `npm run format` — Prettier (includes prettier-plugin-astro + prettier-plugin-tailwindcss)

No test runner is configured. Pre-commit hooks (husky + lint-staged) run `eslint --fix` on `*.{ts,tsx,astro}` and `prettier --write` on `*.{json,css,md}`.

Before first build, run `npx astro sync` to generate virtual module types (required for `astro:env/server` imports to resolve).

## Architecture

Astro 6 SSR app with React 19 islands, Tailwind 4, Supabase auth, and shadcn/ui components. Deployed to Cloudflare Workers.

### Rendering and routing

Full SSR (`output: "server"` in astro.config.mjs). All pages are server-rendered. There is no static prerendering.

- Pages: `src/pages/` (Astro file-based routing)
- API routes: `src/pages/api/` — export uppercase HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`); validate input with zod
- Layout: `src/layouts/Layout.astro` — wraps all pages, renders missing-config banners via `src/lib/config-status.ts`

### Auth flow

Supabase auth is optional — the app runs without credentials (auth features are disabled, `createClient` returns `null`). When configured:

- `src/lib/supabase.ts` — creates Supabase SSR client using cookie-based sessions. Env vars (`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_KEY`) come from `astro:env/server` (declared in astro.config.mjs `env.schema` as optional server secrets).
- `src/middleware.ts` — resolves user on every request, sets `context.locals.user`. Redirects unauthenticated users from `PROTECTED_ROUTES` to `/auth/signin`.
- `src/env.d.ts` — declares `App.Locals` with `user: User | null`.
- Auth API: `src/pages/api/auth/{signin,signup,signout}.ts`
- Auth UI: `src/pages/auth/{signin,signup,confirm-email}.astro`

### Key conventions

- **Import order**: group imports separated by a blank line, each preceded by a comment header:
  1. `// core` — framework and library imports (react, astro, supabase, zod)
  2. `// components` — component imports (Astro and React components, UI primitives)
  3. `// others` — types, hooks, constants, utilities, services
- **Local imports**: use relative paths (`./`, `../`) for files under `src/`. The `@/` alias is **banned** for local files and enforced by ESLint (`no-restricted-imports`). The `@/*` mapping is retained in `tsconfig.json` only so shadcn/ui tooling resolves — after `npx shadcn add`, convert any generated `@/` import to a relative path.
- **Astro components** for layout/static content; **React components** (`client:*` directives) only when interactivity is needed.
- **Tailwind classes**: always merge with `cn()` from `src/lib/utils` (relative import). Never concatenate class strings manually.
- **shadcn/ui**: components in `src/components/ui/`, "new-york" style. Add new ones with `npx shadcn@latest add [name]`, then rewrite the generated `@/` imports to relative paths.
- **React**: no Next.js directives ("use client"/"use server"). Extract hooks to `src/components/hooks/`.
- **Async buttons**: any button that triggers an async action (form submit, mutation, API POST/PATCH) must show a pending state — `disabled` while in-flight and swap its label/icon for a spinner + pending text. Reuse the `animate-spin` ring from `src/components/auth/SubmitButton.tsx`, driven by an explicit `submitting`/`pending` flag (forms post to URLs, so `useFormStatus` won't report pending). Keep the pending state through a success redirect; reset only on error. See `FormActions` in `src/components/fleet/VehicleForm.tsx`.
- **Services/helpers**: `src/lib/` (or `src/lib/services/` for extracted business logic).
- **Shared types**: `src/types.ts` (entities, DTOs).
- **Supabase migrations**: `supabase/migrations/` with format `YYYYMMDDHHmmss_short_description.sql`. Always enable RLS on new tables with per-operation, per-role policies.

### Environment

- Node.js v22.14.0 (`.nvmrc`)
- Local Supabase: `npx supabase start` (requires Docker)
- Deploy: `npx wrangler deploy`

## CI

GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): runs `astro sync` + lint + build on push/PR to `master`. Requires `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` as repository secrets.

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 3, Lesson 1

Open Module 3 by producing a **durable, risk-first quality contract** before any test is written — then drive each rollout phase through the standard change chain.

```
PRD + roadmap + archive
        │
        ▼
   /10x-test-plan  ──►  context/foundation/test-plan.md  (strategy §1–§5 frozen + cookbook §6 grows)
        │
        ▼  (one rollout phase at a time, /clear between handoffs)
   /10x-new ──► /10x-research ──► /10x-plan ──► /10x-implement
```

`/10x-test-plan` is a **stateful orchestrator**, not a one-shot generator. On first run it writes the phased rollout to `context/foundation/test-plan.md`. On every subsequent run it re-derives state from on-disk artifacts and presents the next handoff. The lesson focus is **strategy and rollout sequencing, not configuration**. Hooks, MCP servers, and CI YAML are configured in later lessons of this module.

### Task Router - Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Quality strategy as a rules-file (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-test-plan` | You have a PRD (and ideally a roadmap and a few archived slices) and you are about to write the project's first tests, or you noticed that AI-generated tests are landing on helpers while critical flows go uncovered. First invocation runs discovery (PRD + roadmap + archive + hot-spot scan), a 5-question user interview, and a synthesis pass with a mandatory challenger check, then writes `test-plan.md` in `context/foundation/` with a risk map (5–7 failure scenarios), a phased rollout table, a stack table, a quality-gates table, a cookbook section (`§6`, fills in as phases ship), and a negative-space section (what we deliberately don't test). Subsequent invocations advance the rollout one handoff at a time. |
| `/10x-test-plan --status` | A `test-plan.md` already exists and you want a compact snapshot of where the rollout stands — which phases are `not started`, `change opened`, `researched`, `planned`, `implementing`, or `complete`, and what the next action is. Does no work; safe to run any time. |
| `/10x-test-plan --refresh` | A `test-plan.md` already exists and one of: a new top-3 risk surfaced from the roadmap or archive, a tool's `checked:` date is older than three months, the project's tech stack changed, or §7 negative-space no longer matches what the team believes. Opens a new `test-plan-refresh-<YYYY-MM-DD>` change folder rather than editing the guide in place. |

### Rollout chain — what happens after the guide is written

The guide's §3 *Phased Rollout* table is the orchestrator's state. For each non-`complete` row the orchestrator selects the next handoff based on which artifacts exist in `context/changes/<change-id>/`:

| State on disk | Next handoff | Status transitions to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| change folder missing | `/10x-new <change-id>` | `change opened` |
| `change.md` only | `/10x-research` (with a risks-to-verify brief) | `researched` |
| `+ research.md` | `/10x-plan` (with cost × signal + cookbook-update constraints) | `planned` |
| `+ plan.md` with pending `## Progress` items | `/10x-implement <change-id> phase <N>` | `implementing` / `complete` |
| `+ plan.md` fully `[x]` | Mark §3 row `complete`; loop to next pending row | — |

Each handoff is a **STOP point**. The orchestrator copies the next command to the clipboard, asks the user to `/clear` and run it, then exits. Re-invoke `/10x-test-plan` (no arguments) to advance.

### Risk-first prioritization rules

- Risks are **failure scenarios in user / business terms**, not test names. "Logged-out user reaches paid content via stale token" is a risk; "test the login form" is not.
- 5 to 7 risks. Fewer is too coarse; more makes prioritization useless.
- Impact and likelihood are user/business ratings, not technical complexity.
- Every risk traces to a source: PRD section, archived slice, roadmap entry, Phase 2 interview question, hot-spot **directory** with churn count, or a tech-stack constraint. No invented risks.
- **Signal, not knowledge.** §2 cites *evidence that raised the risk*, never a file as "where the failure lives." File:line anchors, function names, schema names, and module names are forbidden in §2 — they belong in `/10x-research`'s output, produced per rollout phase against current code. The plan is a QA spec; it is not a code audit.
- Coverage is not the metric. **Risk coverage** is the metric.

### Dual-layer mapping rules

- Classic layer first: the cheapest test that gives a real signal wins. Promote to e2e only when no cheaper layer covers the risk.
- AI-native layer second, and only where it adds signal classic tests do not give cheaply.
- Every AI-native row has a **"When NOT to use"** line. If you cannot write one, drop the row.
- Every tool name carries a `checked: <YYYY-MM-DD>` date. Tool names are examples of the category, not endorsements.
- Both layers must be non-empty in the final guide if the project warrants them. Classic-only is a 2020 plan; AI-native-only is hype. AI-native phases are not mandatory — include them only when the brief justified them under cost × signal.

### Quality gates rules

- Required gates (lint, typecheck, unit+integration, e2e on critical flows) must map to actual CI steps. If a required gate is not yet wired, mark it as `required after §3 Phase <N>` and let the named rollout phase wire it.
- Post-edit hook is **recommended local**, not a CI substitute.
- Multimodal visual review is **selective**, applied to 1–3 critical screens, not to every page.
- Vision-driven fallback (Anthropic Computer Use or OpenAI CUA) is reserved for DOM-unreachable surfaces; expensive per action.

### Cookbook patterns (§6) — fills in over time

`test-plan.md` is both a phased strategy and a **growing cookbook**. §6 starts as placeholders (`TBD — see §3 Phase <N>`) and fills in incrementally — each rollout phase's plan ends with a sub-phase that updates the relevant §6 entry (location, naming, reference test, run command). After Module 3 completes, §6 becomes the canonical answer to "how do I add a test for X in this project?" — and is what `/10x-tdd` reads in Lesson 2.

### Lesson boundaries

- Do not write test code. That is Lesson 2 (`/10x-tdd` and unit-test authoring).
- Do not configure hooks, hook lifecycle, or debugging hooks. That is Lesson 3.
- Do not configure MCP servers, Playwright API, e2e code, or multimodal scenario code. That is Lesson 4.
- Do not run the bug-to-fix-to-regression-test workflow. That is Lesson 5.
- Do not author CI/CD pipelines from scratch or write GitHub Actions YAML. The guide names gates; configuration is owned by Module 1 Lesson 5 and Module 2 Lesson 5.
- Do not benchmark multimodal models. Cite criteria (cost, latency, agent-friendliness), never a ranking.
- Do not read the codebase for knowledge (call graphs, schemas, "which file owns this failure"). That is `/10x-research`'s job, per rollout phase.

### Paths used by this lesson

- `context/foundation/test-plan.md` — the quality contract produced and maintained by `/10x-test-plan`
- `context/foundation/prd.md` — primary risk source
- `context/foundation/roadmap.md` — likelihood weighting
- `context/foundation/tech-stack.md` — stack input (when present)
- `context/archive/<change-id>/plan.md` — implemented risk surface
- `context/changes/<change-id>/` — per-rollout-phase change folder (one per row in §3)
